<h2>Here you will find out tips to secure your home network and what <br>
you should do if you find that a device is vulnerable.
<br><br>
Security Tips For Your Home Network:<br>
1. Change default passwords on anything as soon as possible!<br>
   This might sound simple, but it is the most important thing<br>
   you can do to prevent your network being hacked. The largest<br>
   denial of service attacks so far in history were made by<br>
   thousands of devices such as DVR's and Routers that did not<br>
   have their default credentials changed. Two excellant examples<br>
   of this are the Mirai and Qbot internet of things botnets.<br><br>
2. Make sure any device you have connected to the internet is<br>
   hidden behined NAT on your router. What this means is that<br>
   anyone scanning your network for vulnerable devices will only<br>
   see your router (which will still need securing). For most <br>
   people this will happen automatically when you set devices up<br>
   on your network. To be sure check the devices IP address for a<br>
   private IP address using the commands displayed in the technical<br>
   information page.<br><br>
3. Change your DNS settings to use OpenDNS. OpenDNS provide both<br>
   free and paid for services to allow you to do the following:<br>
   i)   Protect yourself and your family from identity theft.<br>
   ii)  Use parantal controls that protect every device in your home.<br>
   iii) Set up customizable filtering to block certain websites such<br>
        as adult content.<br><br>
   The services mentioned above are free and easy to set up.<br>
   For more information see: <a href='https://www.opendns.com/home-internet-security'>OpenDNS.com</a><br><br>
4. Make sure to update the firmware and software of all your<br>
   devices regularly to be safe from the latest know threats.<br>
   A good example of this not being followed is the 2017 Wannacry<br>
   ransomeware attack. This could have been prevented with a simple<br>
   update which was available months before the attack occured.<br><br>
5. Install a home network monitoring device which will actively<br>
   monitor your network for malicious activity. Much like your<br>
   anti-virus does for your computer but instead for your entire<br>
   home network.The following link has information on 3 such devices:<br>

What to do if you are vulnerable to Mirai and Qbot?<br><br>
Port 23 was open (telnet) but the password was not cracked -<br>
   In this case you should consider disabling the telnet service<br>
   as SSH should be used instead of it.<br><br>
Port 23 was open and the password was cracked - <br>
   In this case evaluate weather telnet is needed or not by<br>
   checking the devices original documentation or consulting<br>
   the manufacturers web site. If it is not then disable the<br>
   service as mentioned above. If it needs to be left enabled<br>
   then change its password to something else and consider<br>
   getting a replacement for the device. For examples in changing<br>
   telnet passwords see the Technical information page.<br>
