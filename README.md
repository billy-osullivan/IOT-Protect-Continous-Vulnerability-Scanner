# IOT-Protect-Continous-Vulnerability-Scanner
A continous vulnerability scanner which scanys for Qbot and Mirai vulnerabilites and displays results in a browser

Hardware requirements:
Raspberry Pi.
16x2 LCD.
Push to make push button.
Enclosure.

Software requirments:
Apache2.
Python 2.7.
Adafruit python lcd library - pip install adafruit-charlcd
Shodan API library - pip install shodan

Other requirements:
A config file named conf.cfg should be created in the same location the python script is stored with the following 
information in it - shodan API key.
This key is available for free at: https://developer.shodan.io/

Notes on contents:

This repositry contains everything needed to get the CVS server up and running -
html code, php code, css code and python scripts. All of which should be placed in
/var/www/html.
Inorder to allow the putty applications to be downloaded from the CVS, download from putty.org
and place in /var/www/html.

Notes on operation and setup:

Change the default rapsberry pi login details, and disable telnet if it is enabled.

The python scripts iotprotect.py and lcd.py should be set up to run on system boot. See the following website for details:
https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/8734/execute-script-on-start-up

If problems with permissions are encountered in running these scripts automatically, they can be set up to run without sudo
priveledges. See the following site for details:
https://askubuntu.com/questions/155791/how-do-i-sudo-a-command-in-a-script-without-being-asked-for-a-password

Any pins mentioned for connecting the 16x2 LCD to the raspberry pi are customisable. Please see your LCD pinout for 
further information.

Once setup, the LCD will display the IP address of the server. This will be used to access the login page of the server through a web
browser (for a better experience use Fire Fox). In order for the page to be accessible, the push button needs to be pressed. 
This button is monitored by LCD.py, which controls the LCD and also enables the apache service for 5 minutes.
Once the 5 minutes are up the apache service is disabled again by the LCD.py script.

For debugging purposes the iotprotect.py script will output results to a terminal on the raspberry pi OS as well as to two text files 
for use by the web pages.
